			🇺🇸 Yo, "DOGE Lord" rocks! You’re the DOGE Lord slashing inefficiency to &lt; 100 in 30 turns. Click "View Status," "Manage Resources," "Reform Agencies," or hack/bark with Elon—end your turn for wacky events! Win bigly, share on X with #DOGELord, or laugh off a loss. Much fun, wow! 🚀

		What’s the Game?
		Picture this: You’re the supreme leader of the Doge Nation, tasked with whipping three bumbling government agencies—Transportation, Education, and Defense—into shape. Their inefficiency is through the roof (like 185 points of useless red tape!), and it’s your job to cut it down to below 100 in just 30 turns. But watch out—your resources (Money, Political Capital, and Manpower) are tighter than Elon Musk’s Twitter budget, and random shenanigans (like Elon tweeting memes or a budget cut) will keep you on your toes!
		<p>
			Tap Those Buttons: No typing needed—hit the buttons at the bottom! They’re big, green, and begging to be clicked. Here’s the order to rule like a Doge Lord:
			View Status: Peek at your agencies’ mess (e.g., “Transportation’s inefficiency is 60—yikes!”). Start here to plan your attack.
			Manage Resources: Trade resources if you’re running low (e.g., “Hire Consultants” for 50 Money to gain 20 Manpower—because who doesn’t love a good hustle?).
			Reform Agencies: Pick “Reform Transportation,” “Reform Education,” or “Reform Defense” to slash inefficiency with strategies like “Process Reengineering” or “Tesla Efficiency Boost.” Costs cash, political clout, and manpower, but it’s worth it for the savings! ⚖️💰
			Hack Bureaucracy or Elon’s Tweet Challenge: Optional fun! “Hack Bureaucracy” is a quick tap fest (hit “YES” 3 times in 5 seconds to cut inefficiency), and “Elon’s Tweet Challenge” lets you agree or disagree with Elon for resource wins or losses—hilarious either way!
			End Turn: Wrap up your reign and see what chaos hits next (e.g., “Elon Tweets a Meme!” or “Budget Cut!”). Don’t let inefficiency stay high, or you’re toast!
			<p>
				The Rules
				
				Goal: Slash total inefficiency below 100 in 30 turns, or it’s game over, and you’re just another Doge with a desk job. Win, and you’re the Efficiency Lord—much wow! ⚖️🚀
				Resources: Use Money, Political Capital, and Manpower wisely. Spend too much, and you’ll be barking up the wrong tree!
				Random Wackiness: Every turn, there’s a 20% chance of a wild event—like a “Worker Strike” stealing Manpower or Elon boosting your Political Capital with a tweet. It’s like playing dodgeball with a Shiba Inu!
				No Cheating, Much Patriotism: Play fair, save America, and laugh at the bureaucracy. If you mess up, just hit “Play Again”—no one’s perfect, not even a Doge Lord!
